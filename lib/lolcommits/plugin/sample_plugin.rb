      # and/or a Hash (by overriding the `default_options` method).
      #
      # By default (on initialize), `@options` is set with `[:enabled]`. This is
      # mandatory since `enabled?` checks this option is true before running any
      # capture hooks.
      #
      # Using a Hash to define default options allows you to:
      #
      #  - fall back to default values
      #  - define nested options, user is prompted for each nested option key
      #
      # `configure_option_hash` will iterate over all options prompting the user
      # for input and building the configuration Hash.
      #
      # Lolcommits will save this Hash to a YAML file. During the capture
      # process the configuration is loaded, parsed and available in the plugin
      # class as `@configuration`. Or if you want to fall back to default
      # values, you should use `config_option` to dig the hash.
      #
      # Alternatively you can override this method entirely to customise the
      # process. A helpful `parse_user_input` method is available to help parse
      # strings from STDIN (into boolean, integer or nil values).
